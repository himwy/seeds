Clients of family offices typically have family assets in excess of $100 million.\n\nWhen the accumulation of wealth reaches a certain level, high-end customers have huge financial needs, and they need professional advice and related wealth inheritance plans.\n\nThe family office business allows high-end clients to properly arrange their assets, and it is also a strong backing for the client's family wealth, which can make them feel at ease and effectively pass on the family wealth across generations.\n\nHong Kong is a place where capitalists are concentrated. With the rapid development of the Greater Bay Area, the family office market has a huge space for development.",

The family constitution refers to the arrangement of family rules, family traditions and property distribution rights within the family, so that the core values and family spirit of the family can be passed on from generation to generation.\n\nIn addition to paying attention to wealth appreciation, the families of high-end customers also attach great importance to the family culture, so there will be various professionals in the market to provide corresponding services.",

However, in the huge capital market of Hong Kong, clients around financial planners also need family trusts.\n\nSince financial planners are restricted by their own business, they must rely on a good network of professional relationships to meet the needs of high-end clients.\n\nWendy Lee and Mansfield Lai of Seeds Financial Group have served in the insurance industry for many years and have accumulated and established a mature and reliable relationship network to meet the needs of team clients.\n\nSeeds Financial Group sees the development potential of the Greater Bay Area and knows that the wealth management needs of high-end customers will only increase in the next 10 years. Therefore, we have made adequate preparations to meet the opportunities in the financial market.",

She is also a wife, living happily with her husband in peaceful urban life. Being a financial industry elite is not easy - a clear mind is essential, but more importantly, the ability to remain calm under pressure and adapt to change.

The couple's peaceful life was completely shattered overnight, with both minds filled with thoughts of how to fight the disease. What about medical expenses? What about work at hand? The only fortunate thing was that they both bought premium medical insurance, which was like a glimmer of hope in the darkness to keep them going. When Wendy learned of the situation, she was very worried for the wife, knowing she needed to juggle her busy daily work while taking on the responsibility of caring for her husband alone - the pressure she had to bear was extraordinary.",

          content: "Wendy closely followed the couple's claims process and maintained close contact with the wife, offering care and hoping to help them as much as possible during this most difficult time. Professionals generally give the impression of being calm and composed, with rational attitudes. However, people's vulnerable side often shows during life's lowest points. On the day her husband needed hospitalization, the wife completely broke down. From that day on, she worried about her husband's health every minute and second, having to care for him while juggling heavy work responsibilities. Hospital bills became the trigger for her emotional breakdown. This woman, seen by others as a strong woman, became hysterical overnight, calling Wendy dozens of times over several days, just asking the insurance company to quickly compensate for hospitalization and medical expenses.",

She felt lost, helpless, and worried. At this moment, she was no longer some financial titan; she was just an ordinary wife worried about her husband. Years of experience allowed Wendy to understand and sympathize with the wife's behavior - she wasn't the first, nor would she be the last client to panic over concerns for loved ones. Wendy didn't engage in lengthy explanations with her, knowing that what the wife needed most at this moment was care and comfort, not entanglement with the insurance company. This couple ultimately received full compensation, totaling HK$1 million. When handing over the check, Wendy quietly felt fortunate for the couple, glad they both had purchased premium medical insurance. During life-and-death moments of critical illness, they could still grasp this last straw, preventing them from falling into financial ruin and losing both work and health.",

Steve Jobs once said that when doctors told him he had pancreatic cancer, he didn't even know where the pancreas was. Yes, there are too many diseases and possibilities in this world, but some people just happen to contract diseases you've never even heard of. The story's protagonist was very fortunate - his lacrimal gland cancer was discovered early ten years ago, and he recovered and was discharged after treatment.",

          content: "During a recent casual conversation with Wendy, when she asked about his health condition, he said thank God, fortunately medical care is now advanced, and even cancer could be treated well before. When asked about medical expenses, it was discovered that he had not applied to the company for critical illness insurance compensation. Years ago, he had bought insurance from Company P, but the intermediary was no longer managing the policy and had disappeared, so no one reminded him, and he forgot to apply for compensation. Wendy suggested he still go to the insurance company to make a claim. Although there was a chance of being denied compensation, he should still try his luck. She offered to accompany him to fill out forms and inquire about relevant procedures.",
        },
        section3: {
          title: "Unexpected Success",
          content: "The friend initially refused, fearing it would trouble Wendy. Wendy knew he didn't understand the procedures - he had even forgotten to apply for compensation initially, so she was afraid he might make mistakes again and insisted on accompanying him. Many insurance companies set time limits for claims reporting in policy terms, generally 1-3 months. At the time, they weren't necessarily expecting to get compensation, as it had been ten years after all, and there was considerable possibility of being denied by the insurance company, so neither had too high expectations. The claims procedure wasn't complicated; whether compensation could be recovered depended on whether the insurance company was willing to help this customer. Wendy thought to herself that it would be such a pity if compensation couldn't be recovered - after all, buying insurance was meant to provide a lump sum cash guarantee when suffering from critical illness. Ten years really wasn't a short time, but given the circumstances, they could only try with determination.",
        },
        section4: {
          title: "A Remarkable Outcome",
          content: "A few weeks later, Wendy received a phone call. Her friend called to tell her the insurance compensation had been approved - over HK$800,000. After repeated words of thanks, he said he never thought he could receive compensation years after falling ill, unsure whether to say it was the insurance company's benevolence or heaven rewarding his efforts to overcome the critical illness. This money later became funding for his master's degree studies - the initial small investment creating wealth that allowed him to continue his education ten years later. Many urbanites have various myths and misconceptions about insurance, viewing insurance companies as predators, thinking they only collect premiums while avoiding all compensation as much as possible. In fact, each of us has our own protection needs, and insurance companies, as providers of protection, often try their best to help policyholders get assistance. Although they are commercial institutions, bringing protection to customers is ultimately the true mission of insurance companies. It's precisely because of upholding this mission and philosophy that the insurance industry has been able to develop into one of the pillars of today's financial industry over more than a hundred years, with industry growth rates maintaining exponential growth.",
